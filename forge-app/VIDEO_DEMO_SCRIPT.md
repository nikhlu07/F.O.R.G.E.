# F.O.R.G.E. Video Demo Script
## 3-Minute Demo for Hackathon Submission

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:15) **15 seconds**

**[Show: Main Landing Page]**

> "What if corruption in government spending didn't have to exist? Welcome to **F.O.R.G.E.** - the Financial Oversight & Resource Governance Engine. I'm going to show you how we're using blockchain, AI, and autonomous systems to create unbreakable transparency."

**[Action: Click "Live Dashboard" button]**

---

## 1. The Problem (0:15 - 0:30) **15 seconds**

**[Show: Citizen Dashboard - Community Reports]**

> "Every year, billions in development funds vanish into ghost projects and shell companies. Let's see how F.O.R.G.E. prevents this."

**[Action: Hover over high-risk claim]**

> "This claim - $2 million for a road project - has a fraud score of 85. Our AI detected multiple red flags."

**[Switch to Flow Orchestrator]**

---

## 2. The Complete Workflow (0:30 - 1:15) **45 seconds**

**[Show: Flow Orchestrator - Disbursement Flow]**

> "Here's our complete disbursement workflow: Central â†’ State â†’ District â†’ Vendor. Watch what happens when a suspicious payment is attempted."

**[Action: Demonstrating steps]**

### Step 1: Fund State (0:35)
> "First, Central Government allocates funds to the state. This happens on the blockchain - immutable and transparent."

**[Click: "Transfer 10,000 to State"]**

### Step 2: State to District (0:42)
> "The state then delegates to districts. Each transfer is recorded on Hedera's immutable ledger."

**[Click: "Transfer 5,000 to District"]**

### Step 3: Upload & Fraud Check (0:50)
> "Now a vendor submits a claim with an invoice. We upload it, and our AI fraud engine analyzes it in real-time."

**[Upload file, then click "Run Fraud Check"]**

> "Look at the results: **Decision: Reject. Score: 85**. Our AI found shell company indicators, missing documentation, and risk patterns."

### Step 4: Blocked (1:05)
> "Because the fraud score exceeded our threshold, the payment is automatically blocked. No human corruption possible."

**[Show: Blocked state - button disabled]**

---

## 3. Multi-Party Transparency (1:15 - 2:00) **45 seconds**

**[Switch: Government Dashboard]**

> "Different stakeholders see different views. Here's what central government sees."

**[Action: Click through different dashboard views]**

**[Show: State Government Dashboard]**
> "State governments monitor their districts in real-time."

**[Show: Deputy Dashboard]**
> "Deputies see only what they need to approve."

**[Show: Vendor Dashboard]**
> "Vendors track their claims transparently."

**[Show: Citizen Dashboard]**
> "And citizens can challenge any suspicious payment directly."

---

## 4. Blockchain Integration (2:00 - 2:30) **30 seconds**

**[Show: Hedera Audit Widget]**

> "Every critical action is logged on Hedera's blockchain. Watch this fraud challenge submission."

**[Click: "Submit Challenge to HCS"]**

> "The transaction is recorded, timestamped, and immediately verifiable on HashScan."

**[Click through to HashScan URL]**
> "Here's the transaction on Hedera's public ledger. Immutable. Verifiable. Transparent."

**[Switch to AI Auditor Dashboard]**

---

## 5. AI-Powered Detection (2:30 - 2:50) **20 seconds**

**[Show: AI Auditor Dashboard with alerts]**

> "Our autonomous AI auditor continuously monitors all transactions."

> "It detected this phantom project - a $1.5M hospital equipment payment for a building that doesn't exist. The AI flagged it based on pattern matching with historical fraud cases."

**[Highlight: "Phantom Project" alert]**

---

## Closing (2:50 - 3:00) **10 seconds**

**[Return to main landing page]**

> "F.O.R.G.E. isn't just code - it's programmable governance. Transparent. Immutable. Autonomous. Corruption is now a legacy bug. Thank you."

**[Show: Title slide with logo and tagline]**
